The `app.serve()` method is the core handler for processing `HTTP` requests in `TezX` when running in Bun. It bridges Bun's server with your application logic, executing middleware and route handlers seamlessly.

## What It Does

* Accepts a **Fetch API-compatible `Request`**.
* Receives Bun’s `Server` instance for runtime context.
* Executes your defined **middleware chain**.
* Dispatches **route handlers**.
* Returns a **`Response` object** for Bun to send.

This provides a **plug-and-play** integration with Bun without any additional setup.

---

## Method Signature

```ts
public async serve(req: Request, server: Bun.Server): Promise<Response>
```

* `req` — The native Bun/Fetch API request object.
* `server` — Bun server instance, used internally for request context if needed.

---

## Usage Example (Bun)

```ts
import { wsHandlers } from "tezx/ws";

// Minimal integration
Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch: (req ,server) => app.serve(req, server)
});

// Full Bun server with WebSocket support
Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch: app.serve,
  websocket: wsHandlers({})
});
```

---

> `app.serve()` in Bun is your **direct bridge** between the server runtime and application logic — fast, simple, and fully integrated.
