# TezX v4 (Bun Edition)

**TezX** is a modern, ultra-lightweight, and high-performance JavaScript framework built **specifically for Bun**.
It provides a **minimal yet powerful API**, seamless environment management, and a high-concurrency HTTP engine for building fast, scalable web applications.

---

## Key Features (Bun-only)

* ⚡ **Ultra-Fast Performance** – Optimized for Bun’s native HTTP engine and streams.
* 🧩 **Minimal & Intuitive API** – Clean and simple routing, middleware, and static file serving.
* 🔌 **Flexible Middleware** – Stackable, composable, and easy to manage.
* 🗂 **Static File Serving** – Efficient streaming, automatic MIME detection, optional **ETag** support.
* 🧭 **Dynamic Routing** – Pattern-based, parameterized, and nested routes.
* 🌍 **Environment-First Design** – Easy `.env` loading with typed access via `Bun.env`.
* 🔐 **Secure by Default** – Safe headers, CORS, caching, and other best practices baked in.

---

## Installation

```bash
bun add tezx
```

---

## Environment Setup

TezX v4 is **Bun-native** and leverages `Bun.env` for configuration:

```ts
import { TezX } from "tezx";

const app = new TezX();
const port = Number(Bun.env.PORT || 3000);
```

---

## Quick Start

```ts
import { TezX } from "tezx";
import { serveStatic } from "tezx/static";

const app = new TezX();

// ✅ Simple GET route
app.get("/", (ctx) => ctx.html("<h1>Welcome to TezX v4 for Bun</h1>"));

// ✅ Static files
app.static(serveStatic("/public", "./public"));

// ✅ Middleware example
app.use((ctx, next) => {
  console.log(`Incoming request: ${ctx.req.url}`);
  return next();
});

// ✅ Start server
Bun.serve({
  port,
  fetch(req, server) {
    return app.serve(req, server);
  },
});

console.log(`🚀 TezX v4 running at http://localhost:${port}`);
```

---

## 🗂 Static File Serving

```ts
import { serveStatic } from "tezx/static";

app.static(serveStatic("/assets", "./assets"));
```

* Efficient **streaming** for large files.
* Automatic **MIME type detection**.
* Optional **ETag** and caching for faster reloads.

---

## Routing Examples

```ts
// GET request
app.get("/about", (ctx) => ctx.html("<h1>About TezX</h1>"));

// POST request
app.post("/submit", (ctx) =>
  ctx.json({ message: "Form submitted successfully" })
);
```

---

## Error Handling

```ts
app.onError((err, ctx) => {
  console.error(err);
  return ctx.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
});
```

---

## Development

Run your app with Bun:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

* Supports **hot reload** with Bun.
* Access your app at: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Notes

* Fully **Bun optimized** – no Node.js or Deno dependencies required.
* Combine **routing**, **middleware**, and **static serving** to build production-ready apps.
* Lightweight and scalable, perfect for microservices and high-concurrency apps.
